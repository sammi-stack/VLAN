# VLAN

VLAN (Virtual LAN):
A VLAN is a logical grouping of devices on a network, even if they are not physically connected to the same switch. VLANs allow you to segment your network into isolated broadcast domains, improving security, network performance, and manageability.

Router on a Stick:
In a network with multiple VLANs, devices within the same VLAN can communicate easily, but if you want devices from different VLANs to communicate, you need a router. A "Router on a Stick" configuration involves connecting a single physical router interface to a trunk port on a switch. The router then handles routing traffic between different VLANs.
